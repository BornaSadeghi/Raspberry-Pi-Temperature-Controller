# Raspberry-Pi-Temperature-Controller
Monitors CPU temperature and activates the fan when it gets too hot.

To use, simply cd into the directory and run the start command with source:

`source start`


If this doesn't work, you may need to install some packages first.

Ensure that you have pip, and the required packages:

`sudo apt install python3-pip && pip3 install gpiozero matplotlib`
